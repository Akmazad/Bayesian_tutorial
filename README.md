# Bayesian MCMC phylogenetics tutorial in R

This tutorial guides the user through writing a simple MCMC phylogenetics 
program to estimate the molecular distance and the transition/trasversion
for a pairwise sequence alignment under Kimura's (1980) substitution
model. The tutorial introduces concepts such as burn-in, mixing and 
convergence of the MCMC, efficiency and autocorrelation, and MCMC
diagnostics.
