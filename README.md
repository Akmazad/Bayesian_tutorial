# Bayesian MCMC phylogenetics tutorial in R

This tutorial guides the user through writing a simple MCMC phylogenetics 
program to estimate the molecular distance and the transition/trasversion
for a pairwise sequence alignment under Jukes and Cantor (1969) and Kimura's (1980) substitution
model. The tutorial introduces concepts such as burn-in, mixing and 
convergence of the MCMC, efficiency and autocorrelation, and MCMC
diagnostics.

We also provide the solution for exercise 7 included in the JC.R tutorial.
